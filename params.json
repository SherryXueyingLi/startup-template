So any tab defined but lower then level two will be ignored.\r\n\r\n###Routing\r\nBy using 'resolve', it help load the controller and trigger a click event after successfully loaded.\r\nIf the controller have already loaded, just return, because we don't need to register a controller each time.\r\n`resolve: {\r\n                tabController: ['$state',function($state){\r\n                    if(cache[this.data.state]) return;\r\n                    var data = this.data;\r\n                    return load(data).then(function(state){\r\n                \t    $(\"#\"+state).click();\r\n                    });\r\n                }]\r\n            },`\r\n\r\n## requirejs+angularjs/example\r\nThis project shows how to set up a requirejs+angularjs-based website, with a proper routing menu tab.\r\n\r\n",
