So any tab defined but lower then level two will be ignored.\r\n\r\n###Routing\r\nBy using 'resolve', it help load the controller and trigger a click event after successfully loaded.\r\nIf the controller have already loaded, just return, because we don't need to register a controller each time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## requirejs+angularjs/example\r\nThis project shows how to set up a requirejs+angularjs-based website, with a proper routing menu tab.\r\n\r\nTest it out [here](http://sherryxueyingli.github.io/startup-template/www/startup/index.html#/main)\r\n",
